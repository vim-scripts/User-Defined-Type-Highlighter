For Vim version 6.1. Last change 26 April 2002 

			VIM REFERENCE	by Michael Brailsford

This plugin requires the |Ruby| interface.  Check the output of |:version|
for |+ruby|, if you see it then you are good to go, otherwise you will need
to get a new vim package, or recompile with the --enable-rubyinterp option.

The script described here is a filetype plugin, see |add-filetype-plugin|.
This plugin is only available if 'compatible' is not set.

{Vi has none of this}

================================================================================
							*udt_description*
Description: 

udt_highlight.vim creates vim syntax highlighting groups for typedefs,
structs, and classes that are found in C++ header files.  It creates three
syntax highlighting groups, one each for typedefs, structs, and classes,
so if you want you can highlight those seperately.  I ran the command line
version of this script on /usr/include, it generated a large highlighting.
That highlighting file is included with this plugin.

================================================================================
							*udt_install*
Installation:

You need to download the tar file from vim.sf.net, and untar the file in your
~/.vim/ directory.  Then you need to do one of two things, either copy the
file se_core.rb to /usr/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.6/ directory, or add the path
to se_core.rb to the $SE_CORE environment variable.  This is also distributed
with a command line version.  You should udt.rb to whereever you put scripts
on your system.  To see the documentation that you are reading you have to
add "udt_highlight.txt" to ~/.vim/doc and run |helptags|.  For more info
see |add-local-help|

File list:

se_core.rb
udt.rb
ftplugin/cpp/udt.vim
doc/udt_highlight.txt
after/syntax/cpp/usr_include.vim

NOTE:  Do _NOT_ forget to either move se_core.rb to
/usr/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.6/ (recommended), or add the path to se_core.rb in
the environment variable $SE_CORE.

================================================================================
							*udt_config*
Configuration:

There are several options that can be set in your |vimrc| which will control
the way that this plugin works, and its output.  These all need to be set with |let|.

							*udt_config_options*
Options:

The following options can all be set in your |vimrc|.

			*udt_recurse* *udt_recursive*
udt_recursive		number (default 0)
					{not in vi}

	If udt_recursive is not defined then it defaults to 0.	This option
	controls whether the script will search subdirectories looking for
	header files.
	Valid setting are:	
		0 = do not recurse sub-directories
		1 = recurse sub-directories 

			*udt_tofile*
udt_tofile			{not in vi}

	If this is defined then the output will be written to a file which
	can be sourced at a later time.  This is good for working on projects
	with several developers.
	If it is not defined then the syntax highlighting groups will be
	set through vim commands when Generate_Highlighting() is called.
	The value of this var is unimportant, just define it or don't
	define it.  Setting it to 50, 4000, or "foobar" makes no difference.

			*udt_file* *udt_outputfile*
udt_outputfile		string (default "udt.vim")
					{not in vi}

	This contains the name of the file to which output will be written,
	relative to the current directory.

							*udt_colors*
			*udt_typedef_atts* *udt_struct_atts* *udt_class_atts*
udt_typedef_atts	string (default "guifg=white ctermfg=white gui=bold")
udt_struct_atts		{not in vi}
udt_class_atts
	
	Each of these controls how typedefs, structs, and classes are
	highlighted.  They must be valid params to |highlight|, see
	|highlight-args| for the details.

			*udt_dynamic_load*
udt_dynamic_load
	
	This is not implemented at the moment, but it is being worked on.

================================================================================
							*udt_usage*
Usage:

This script is distributed with both vim filetype plugins and a command
line version.  For the command line version you can see the options that
it accepts by typing "udt --help" or "udt -h".  For the vim ftplugins,
you should read this help doc.  :)

For the command version there isn't much else to say about using it.
Just use it.  Well it does default to outputting to stdout.  The options are
similar to the options above, |udt_config_options|.  With the exception that
it does not support configuration of the colors, |udt_colors|.

For the vim version, you will have to call Generate_Highlighting(), in
order to get the udt highlighting.  Other than that, this whole document is
about how to configure the vim version. :)  Though I have a few suggestions,
make an iabbr to call Generate_Highlighting(), or make an easy to type keymap.

================================================================================
							*udt_todo*
Todo:

Feel free to email me and suggest some more improvements.  I have already
included two suggestions from people that took the time to request them.
I welcome feedback.  Well, these are the current things on the todo, in no
particular order.

	* Add some default keymaps.
	* Provide a mechanism to load all files generated with udt.vim from
	  the current directory towards the root of the filesystem, like with tags.
	* Provide support for other languages... (maybe...) 
	* Add support for enums, enum members, and unions	
	* Add support for dynamic loading from "#include" lines in header file,
	  and associated header file for a .cpp file	

================================================================================
							*udt_bugs*
Bugs:

I am sure that there are many.  If you find one (not that you'll need to
look real hard) send me a description of it and ways to reproduce it to
brailsmt@yahoo.com.  I will fix them as I get time.
